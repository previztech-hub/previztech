Previz Website

This is a minimal Next.js (App Router) scaffold with Tailwind CSS and `lucide-react` icons using the `app` directory.

Quick start (from `previz-website` folder):

```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Run dev server
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- I included `lucide-react` in `package.json`. If you generated the project with `create-next-app` instead, run `npm install lucide-react`.
- Tailwind is configured via `tailwind.config.cjs` and `postcss.config.cjs`.
- The main page is `app/page.js`. I added the code you supplied and included a `use client` directive so React hooks work in the App Router.

If you want, I can run `npm install` here (if you allow terminal execution) or commit these files to git next. What would you like me to do next?
